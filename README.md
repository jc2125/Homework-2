*MY ENTIRE ASSIGNMENT IS DONE IN C++*

Question 1 Algorithm Instructions:
My program uses inputs in order to function, so in order to use my program all that needs to be done is copy my code, and paste it into a C++ compiler. The instructions of my program are laid out very clearly, so once you paste the code into the compiler and run it, it will be very clear as to how it operates. The program will tell you what to do step by step.
